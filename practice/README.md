Heuristics solutions used to solve HashCode 2022 practice round

## Project structure

* instances: contains the differents proposals instances.
* solutions: contains all the solutions found.
* src: contains 4 folders for our metaheuristics proposal and the main method.
  - constructive: where greedy or constructive procedures are developed.
  - improve: it contains the local search methods to find local optimum solutions.
  - model: several functionalities as solution structure, read instances, print solutions, etc.
  - experiments: the global method to run different constructives with localSearchs approaches.

## Proposal algorithms
